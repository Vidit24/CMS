>A content management system (CMS) is a computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content (content management).[1][2][3] A CMS is typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM).

>ECM typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environment[4] by integrating document management, digital asset management, and record retention.[5]

>Alternatively, WCM is the collaborative authoring for websites and may include text and embed graphics, photos, video, audio, maps, and program code that display content and interact with the user.[6][7] ECM typically includes a WCM function. CMS is a web template to create your own website.
